I am a second-year undergraduate student from School of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence, Shanghai University of Finance and Economics.  
Currently, I lack formal research experience or internships, but I have a strong passion for learning. My hobbies include film photography and collecting medals from various countries.  
In a bit of a dilemma about the future.SAD
